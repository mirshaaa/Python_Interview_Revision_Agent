Title: Python Interview Revision Agent
Created by: Mirsha Kudukkan
Tabs Used: 3 (Understanding, Thinking, Responding)

🔍 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a Python Interview Revision Agent that helps users revise Python topics in a structured and layered format.
Instead of giving answers directly, the agent breaks the task into three smart steps:
First, it understands the topic.


Then, it plans how to explain it.


Finally, it responds with a clean, ready-to-use Q&A format.


This architecture simulates how a good teacher or coach would explain Python during interview prep.

🧭 Agent Architecture Overview

🔹 Tab 1: Understanding Agent
Purpose: Takes the user’s vague request and extracts a clear topic and related subtopics.


Style: Guided, structured, acts like a teaching assistant.
Example Output:{  
  "topic": "List Comprehensions",
  "subtopics": ["syntax", "examples", "edge cases"]
      }
🔹 Tab 2: Thinking Agent
Purpose: Plans how to explain the topic in a structured way.


Output Format: YAML structure.


Style: Logical, clear, and designed for education.


Example Output:


topic: List Comprehensions
questions:
  - question: What is a list comprehension?
    answer: A concise way to create lists using one-liner           syntax.
  - question: Provide an example.
    answer: squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
  - question: Any best practices?
    answer: Avoid complex logic inside comprehensions to keep it readable.


🔹 Tab 3: Responding Agent
Purpose: Converts the YAML into a final, user-facing Q&A.


Style: Clear, well-explained, ready for interviews.


Example Output:


Topic: List Comprehensions
Q: What is a list comprehension?
 A: A concise way to create lists using one-liner syntax.
Q: Provide an example.
 A: squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
Q: Any best practices?
 A: Avoid complex logic inside comprehensions to keep it readable.

📂 Full Example Flow
User Input: “I want to revise list comprehensions.”
Tab 1 Output:

{
  "topic": "List Comprehensions",
  "subtopics": ["syntax", "examples", "edge cases"]
}

Tab 2 Output (YAML):

topic: List Comprehensions
questions:
 - question: What is a list comprehension?
    answer: A compact syntax for creating lists.
  - question: Give an example.
    answer: squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
  - question: Any edge cases?
    answer: Avoid using them for complex logic — readability suffers.

Tab 3 Output (Final Q&A):
Topic: List Comprehensions
Q: What is a list comprehension?
 A: A compact syntax for creating lists.
Q: Give an example.
 A: squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
Q: Any edge cases?
 A: Avoid using them for complex logic — readability suffers.

🧠 What I Learned
How to design prompt layers that think step-by-step.


Why modular thinking improves prompt quality.


YAML is a helpful middle format between raw logic and final output.


Even vague user input can be transformed into clarity with the right “Understanding” logic.


Clear planning (via the Thinking tab) improves both explainability and reuse of content.



💡 Future Improvements
Add memory to track what topics were already covered.


Let users select the difficulty level: basic, intermediate, advanced.


Add a quiz or flashcard mode after each explanation.


Expand to other interview topics like SQL, Pandas, NumPy, System Design.


Add an “Interview Tip” after every topic.



✅ Final Reflection
This project helped me understand the value of designing AI agents in a layered, logical way — not just prompt-and-reply.
 I now think more like a system architect when building prompts and workflows.
 It taught me how structured thinking and layered planning lead to better AI outputs.
 Most importantly, I enjoyed how it turned revision into something logical, repeatable, and interview-friendly.
